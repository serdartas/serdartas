Hi, Iâ€™m @serdartas

I've devloped software almost my entire life both as hobby and as the main source of income to feed my family. First thing I thought to myself was learning to learn. 

I started my journey with [GW Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC).
Then learned and developed using [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)).
Haven't stop there and went on with [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language), [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) and am still going on with learning new stuff.
